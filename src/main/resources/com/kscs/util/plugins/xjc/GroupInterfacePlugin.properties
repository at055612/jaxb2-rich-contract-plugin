usage=Transforms <group> and <attributeGroup> XSD definitions to java interface declarations, and makes complexTypes using \
  the group implement this interface.
usage.declareSetters=Also generate property setter methods in interface declarations.
usage.declareBuilderInterface=If the "fluent builder plugin" (-Xfluent-builder) is also active, generate interface for the internal builder classes as well.
usage.upstreamEpisodeFile=Use the given resource file to obtain information about interfaces defined in an upstream module (refer to "-episode" option of XJC).
usage.downstreamEpisodeFile=Generate "episode" file for downstream modules in the given resource location.
usage.supportInterfaceNameSuffix=If this is set, methods that could cause type conflicts when two generated interfaces are used together as type parameter bounds, will be put in another interface named the same as the original interface, but with the suffix specified here.
usage.complexTypeGeneratorStrategy=Choose how to generate the initial model for the interface. "dummy" for using the old strategy that generates an on-the-fly XML schema doc from which the interface definition is generated, "direct" to use the new XSD-independent strategy.
error.plugin-setup=Error setting up group-interface-plugin {0}
error.cannot-instantiate-strategy=Exception while instantiating preprocessing strategy: {0}.
error.no-such-constructor=Strategy class {0} has no default constructor.
